The area is sealed off, and your operational command is not responding; previous mission objectives have lost their purpose. Everybody has personal goals now – adapt and survive, escape the blockade or try to save others.\n\nBe prepared to die and lose everything you had with you in every raid you enter.\nKeep in mind that every drop in your internet connection or hardware malfunction can lead to disconnection from the game with the consecutive death of your character and loss of all the gear you had with you or found within your raid.\n\nYes, you will die, and most probably very often, but remember – this is still a game.

You know, of course, how hard is everyone still gunning for any evidence on TerraGroup and its associates? Exactly. But the folks who tried to get the info out of that foreman happened to be more edgy than smart. The dude’s ticker stopped ticking before his tongue started wagging. Can you imagine? What dimwits! How do you do business with the likes of them? Okay, back to the point. So he grabbed the docs and stashed them somewhere. Asked around a bit, those who worked with him before. In general, chances don’t look too good, but who knows how lucky you can get? In a word, that foreman worked in the chemo shop. The shitmost shit, see. And somewhere on the Customs premises he and his homies had their bunkhouses. Eating there, chilling, most certainly inviting girl over, well, you get it.

I don’t think you will find much there if anything at all. Though he swore there’s something. Something else has surfaced: In the same dorm, he owned one more room, 203, but wasn’t babbling about it and, as a matter of fact, used it for storage. Now that’s where he had something of value for sure, more than one of his errand runners perished there. Also, he had a garage.

Do you know where the chemical factory is? Doesn’t matter now what was produced there and what is happening there now. I mean, who controls it or who tries to secure it. I have a firm suspicion that some sort of poison is leaking from the factory premises into the groundwater. And because of the lack of supplies from the outside, we are all forced to drink this water. Do you understand? Even the filters are no longer effective. If we do not resolve this issue, nobody would need ammo and grenades anymore. To figure it out I need the readings of radio and gas analyzers, which should be in the factory shops next to the water pumps. Look for a small separate room right in the workshops and that's the place where it should be.

Several people saw them carrying large plastic barrels full of clean water to that location. Though I can't blame them for surviving any way they can, we need that water more than they do.

Two stretches, first in juvie, second - two years in minimum security for disorderly conduct. Enough? We done with that? Finally, we can go without gracious word weaving! So look, there is this con. Can’t say it's failproof, but might be interesting. One drunken punk’s been blabbing that during the Contract Wars he used to guide several groups of VIPs who did not want to run into soldiers or cops. And I agree with the latter. It’s still possible to deal with war dogs, normal people are not uncommon among them, but cops are no damn good. Well, in the end, he walked through several of such groups. Oh and fool as he is, he still had enough sense to steal everything he could during breathers. Now that deadbeat swears on his mom’s name that he snatched two flash drives on his latest run. What was on them - if anything at all - he’s got no clue. And he’s been permanently shit-faced for so long that he can’t remember anything at all - no location, no landmarks, nothing. Anyhow, he says there were some bigwigs with the security, so might be worth a while. Check any campsite you find. I know that these paths have been beaten through and through since, but what if, you know?",

Two drones were shot down over the coast, now that getting to them has become possible, we can try to pull out the memory block from these. They should contain information about all movements at the beginning of the conflict. This information can make a good deal with my partners.

He asked for a small fee for his services, in the form of gunpowder, for whatever reason.

The value of art pieces by renowned artists grows every year. They are definitely talented, but the more you look at it, the more it seems that anything can be art. It can be a Rothko painting, a displaced urinal, or a bunch of garbage. However, in my opinion, the most amazing pieces of art are weapons, starting from the melee - which is already universally recognized as such and can be found in many museums - to an old AK or M4, which are beautiful as they are. But a weapon only transcends to true art when it becomes unique, one-of-a-kind, in the hands of someone who knows how to use it, who modifies it for his own needs, creating a masterpiece worthy of being displayed in the best of museums.

Of course, they didn't do it with their own hands, they forced the Scavs to do the job, and most likely none of the poor bastards made it back out. So anyway, I've got no idea what sort of bunker that is. I've had some information that it could be the command bunker. But I'm not sure if it's exactly that bunker or just a bomb shelter for the base personnel. For now, there's no use to send a big group there for them to just die to those raiders.

But you know, now it's even more intriguing, for fuck's sake. So my people will not go there anymore for no reason, but if you could find a safe route for them...
