This is where your character, an operator of a private military company (PMC), will battle other fighters for glory and cash. 

Due to the chaos of the conflict, in the city of Tarkov, Norvinsk region, law and order have taken a back seat. This is the place where rich observers have chosen to organize battles where PMCs will fight each other to the last survivor or work as a team to complete a certain objective - which, of course, they will be set by the Masters. 

If you don't own Escape From Tarkov yet, you can purchase the game and transfer all your progress from the Arena there. 
If you already own Escape From Tarkov, all progress gained in the Arena (experience and skills) will also count for your character in EFT and vice versa - progress in EFT counts for Arena.`,"Arena/Apc/ClearHeader":"Deletion","Arena/Apc/ClearMessage":"Delete all items?","Arena/Apc/CloseHeader":"Confirmation","Arena/Apc/CloseMessage":"Save the changes?","Arena/Apc/CopyHeader":"Build copy","Arena/Apc/CopyMessage":"Loading the selected build will override the current build.

In this game, you will have to fight for your life and survive the perils of Tarkov, a Russian city in the Norvinsk region on the brink of chaos and collapse. Your character is an operator of a Private Military Company (PMC), caught in a maelstrom of events right after the Contract Wars. The area is sealed off, and your operational command is not responding; previous mission objectives have lost their purpose. Everybody has personal goals now – adapt and survive, escape the blockade or try to save others.

Be prepared to die and lose everything you had with you in every raid you enter.
Keep in mind that every drop in your internet connection or hardware malfunction can lead to disconnection from the game with the consecutive death of your character and loss of all the gear you had with you or found within your raid.

Yes, you will die, and most probably very often, but remember – this is still a game.

For now it is an old bomb shelter clogged with rubbish, but by making an effort you can make it a full-fledged underground base with everything you need for comfortable living.

You can use items and resources you found in raids or purchased to build and improve various areas of the Hideout, many of which will give you special bonuses and abilities - increased rate of off-raid health regeneration, energy and hydration, boosted skills leveling, the ability to craft various items, etc.

Escaping from Tarkov can take quite a while, and you need a place where you can regroup and regain strength. This is the place - your Hideout.

Good luck!`,"hideout/Welcome title":"WELCOME TO THE HIDEOUT","hideout/allweapons":"All weapons","hideout/bonus_is_inactive_due_to_energy":"Bonus is inactive due to lack of
